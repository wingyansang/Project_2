# Project_2
This is a project in which I scraped Bike Index using Python's scrapy, combined the data set with demographic data, and performed 
exploratory/statistical analyses using R.

Presentation of analysis is in the ShinyApp folder. The folder also contains 2 data frame files used in the app.	

Code to scrape data is in the Scraping Code folder.

Results of the scraping saved in the bikes.csv file in data folder. The folder also contains demographics data (ACS.csv) downloaded from the US Census and zip code data. 

The R analysis files in the examples folder contain the code to clean data as well as to perform exploratory analyses of the data.

(Please note that opening the Word Cloud panel causes the app to crash on the Shiny server because of file xsize limitations on my free account.)
